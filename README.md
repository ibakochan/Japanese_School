Site for managing students attendance grading late/abscence and your schedule.

The major pages for my site are:

Profile page.

Schedule page.

Todolist page.




On the profile page you can:

Create new students "new accounts".

Check and update attendance record manually.

Check and record late/absence.

Check and record grading materials such as tests and essays.

Check and set user infromation such as classes they belong to, profile pic, date of birth etc.

Check all students based on the schedules they are listed on.



On the Schedule page you can:

Make a new schedule and enter existing schedules.

After clicking on a schedule and going to its page you can make lessons within it.

You can add all users to all lessons in the schedules of the same category as they belong to in one click. If you remove a 

category of a student and then click the button again they will be removed from the schedule of that category as well.

After adding students to each schedule you can now take attendance for each student and also fill out late/absence reports there.

On the Todolist page you can:
Make a todolist and with name and password.
To be able to make and view todo items you have to enter your password for your list.

There is some other functionality as well on the page but these are the major functionalities.
